Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)

I am a graduate student looking for well challenging opportunity to prove myself. My Father is a salesman so I couldn't afford to pay such a huge amount. That amount is very huge to me As I am from a lower middle-class family. I need support and help from Courseera to do the course python. I believe that there is huge scope to learning python and technologies like Bigdata and data science are purely depending on the python and their modules. So, python programming is growing rapidly with a high acceleration rate. So If can complete the course and gain sufficient knowledge even I can also stand on me without any dependency. So please review my application of financial aid and approve it. I would like to hear that my application has accepted to for sure I am so thankful for courseera to provide this wonderful opportunity. Please do this help me!
